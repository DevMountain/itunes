var app = angular.module('itunes');

  //This service is what will do the 'heavy lifting' and get our data from the iTunes API.
  //Also note that we're using a 'service' and not a 'factory' so all your methods you want to call in your controller need to be on 'this'.

  //Write a method that accepts an artist's name as the parameter, then makes a 'JSONP' http request to a url that looks like this
  //https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=' + artist + '&callback=JSON_CALLBACK'
  //Note that in the above line, artist is the parameter being passed in. 
  //You can return the http request or you can make your own promise in order to manipulate the data before you resolve it.

    //Code here
