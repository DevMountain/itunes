iTunes Angular Clone
========

### Learning Objectives (Students willâ€¦):
  - be able to make $http requests to various APIs
  - be able to use outside directives and know how to inject those modules into their application
  - be able to create, return, and resolve their own promises with $q


You now should be to the point where you understand the bigger picture of AJAX, $http requests, and promises. Today, you're going to create an iTunes app which fetches Artists using the iTunes API. 

The concepts this project will cover are:

1. $http
2. Angular Services
3. Injecting a service into your controller
4. Working with third party angular modules (ui-grid)


##Step 1: Clone and Dissect the Repo
* Fork and clone this repository.
* Go and check out http://tylermcginnis.com/itunes. Although that example includes a bunch of filtering options, this project will just be fetching data by artist name.
* Examine the codebase. Like the ChatRoom project, the index.html page is already built for you. Your main goal is to fill in mainCtrl.js and itunesService.js
* If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to change the CSS how you would like.
* Head over to http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-grid/ and check out the examples there. We will be using ui-grid to display the data we get from iTunes. Although all this code will already be in place for you, it's a good idea to get familiar with ui-grid so you know exactly what that code is doing.


##Step 2: Build your itunesService
* In Angular we use 'services' to outsource some of our heavy lifting. That's exactly what we're going to do when we call the iTunes API.
* Open up itunesService.js and read the instructions. The bigger picture is that this service is going to have a method which takes in an artist name as the parameter, then uses a JSONP http request to call the iTunes API and retrieve the data about that specific artist.


##Step 3: Tie in your Controller
* Now that your itunesService is finished, we somehow need a way to tie the data we're getting from itunesService to our view (index.html)
* Go to mainCtrl.js and follow the instructions in order to get the itunes data from your service to your view


##Step 4: Add More Options
* Go back and look at the original data you're getting from iTunes. There is a lot more that you can play around with...
* Add more columns to ui-grid so the user can see more options
* Add a filtering option so they can filter by price, name, etc etc.
* Also add a options dropdown so they can select which type of data they want from iTunes. Artist, song, movie, etc.(In other words, make it exactly like http://tylermcginnis.com/itunes)
